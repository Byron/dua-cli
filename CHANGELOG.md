#### v2.14.7

* Fix deletion which broke with Rust 1.55, for those who are compiling the tool themselves.

#### v2.14.6

* Support for arrow keys as well as Home & End. The help pane was updated to reflect these changes.
* More readable information on how to delete or trash files in the mark pane.

#### v2.14.5

* Fix installation via `cargo install dua-cli`. Please note that it might break again as it still depends on the unsable `clap-3 beta 4`. Even when pinning it breakage is possible as its dependencies itself aren't pinned.

#### v2.14.4

* upgrade depencies
* upgrade to tui 0.16

#### v2.14.3

* upgrade `open` crate to v2

#### v2.14.2

* `Ctrl-T` to trash (instead of removal) is now an optional default feature, allowing it to be
  disabled on FreeBSD which isn't currently supported.
* Update dependencies

#### v2.14.1

* Pressing `ctrl+t` in the mark pane now trashes entries instead of deleting them. Not only does that make
  'deletion' reversible but it makes removal of the entry faster in many cases as well.
* updated dependencies

#### v2.13.1

* Allow usage of the feature introduced in v2.13 by writing the TUI to stderr instead of stdout.
  That way the output can be redirected.

#### v2.13.0

* Print remaining marked paths upon exit on stdout. This may help to use `dua i` with other programs
  who want to process the marked paths on their own.

#### v2.12.2

* Prepare for release of new Apple hardware and be more specific when auto-configuring the correct amount of threads.
  Instead an error message will be printed to inform that the given CPU brand isn't configurable yet.

#### v2.12.1

* Fixed bug that would cause `dua` to unconditionally sleep for 1 second. This sleep was intended for a spawned thread,
  but it slipped into the main thread.

#### v2.12.0 [YANKED]

* Add minimal progress for when `dua` invocations take longer than 1 second

#### v2.11.3 - re-add arm builds

* dependency updates (including tui 0.15)

#### v2.11.2

* dependency updates (including tui 0.15)

#### v2.11.1

* The `-x/--stay-on-filesystem` flag is now respected for multiple root paths, as in `dua -x
  path-FS1/ path-FS2/`, as such `dua` will stay in FS1 if the CWD is in FS1.

#### v2.11.0

##### Features

* Add binding capital 'H' to go to the top of any pane/list
* Add binding capital 'G' to go to the bottom of any pane/list

##### Fixes
* Without user input during `dua i [<multiple paths>]` the top-most entry will remain selected.
* Avoid stale frame at the end of traversal in interactive sessions when there is no user input.

#### v2.10.10 - Fix --version flag

It looks like the latest BETAs of clap removed setting the version implicitly.


#### v2.10.9 - Fix build

Now that `jwalk` was released in v0.6 with v0.5.2 yanked, `cargo install` will use the previous
version v0.5.1 which does not fit the latest `dua` anymore.

This is now fixed and hopefully permanently so thanks to using `jwalk` v0.6.

#### v2.10.8 - Fix build

A breaking change in jwalk can cause builds to fail. This prevents the issue from spreading at least
with dua-cli.

#### v2.10.7 - Better performance on Apple Silicon (M1)

The IO subsystem on Apple Silicon is different and won't scale nicely just by using all amount of available cores. Instead it seems best to only
use as many threads as performance cores are present on the system - otherwise the performance might actually get worse while using more power.

On all other systems, the default number of threads did not change.

**Please note that for optimial performance** one would need an arm build on MacOS, currently provided is only intel builds.

#### v2.10.6 - Fix `dua -h` usage string

#### v2.10.5 - dependency update

* upgrade to TUI v0.13.0

#### v2.10.3 - dependency update

Should fix [this issue](https://github.com/Byron/dua-cli/issues/66)

#### v2.10.2 - Change light-grey color in command-line mode to Cyan to fix disappearing text

#### v2.10.1 - Change light-grey color in interactive mode to Cyan to fix disappearing text

See [this PR](https://github.com/Byron/dua-cli/pull/62) for reference.

#### v2.10.0 - Minor improvements of looks; improved windows support

* previously in interactive mode on Windows, directory sizes would appear as 0 bytes in size. This is now fixed!

#### v2.9.1 - Globs for Windows; fixed handling of colors

* On widnows, `dua` will now expand glob patterns by itself as this capability is not implemented by shells `dua` can now run in.
* A bug was discovered that could cause `dua a` invocation to now show paths behind their size in an incorrect attempt to not print with color.

#### v2.9.0 - Full windows support!

* On Windows, we will now build using `crossterm`, which was greatly facilitated by `crosstermion`.
* On Unix systems, the backend is still `termion`.

#### v2.8.2

* Switch back to `clap` from `argh` to support non-UTF-8 encoded paths to be passed to dua

I hope that `argh` or an alternative will one day consider supporting os-strings, as it would in theory be an issue
for anyone who passes paths to their command-line tool.

#### v2.8.1

* Switch from deprecated `failure` to `anyhow` to reduce compile times a little and binary size by 130kb.

#### v2.8.0

* Switched from `clap` to `argh` for a 300kb reduction in binary size and 1 minute smaller compile times.

#### v2.7.0

* [Support for extremely large][issue-58], zeta byte scale, files or filesystem traversals.
* [Fix possibly incorrect handling of hard links][pr-57] in traversals spanning multiple devices.

Both changes were enabled by [@Freaky](https://github.com/Freaky) whom I hereby thank wholeheartedly :).

[issue-58]: https://github.com/Byron/dua-cli/issues/58
[pr-57]: https://github.com/Byron/dua-cli/pull/57

#### v2.6.1

* quit without delay from interactive mode after `dua` was opened on huge directories trees. 
  See [this commit](https://github.com/Byron/dua-cli/commit/91aade36c71e4e14167030b6ec8c3c13dcdc1b2b) for details.

#### v2.6.0

* Use `x` to only mark entries for deletion, instead of toggling them.
* Add `-x` | `--stay-on-filesystem` flag to force staying on the file system the root is on, similar to `-x` in the venerable `du` tool.

#### v2.5.0 Much more nuanced percentage bars for a more precise visualization of space consumption

#### v2.4.1 Bugfix: Update currently visible entries when scanning

#### v2.4.0 Full interaction during scanning phase; add inline-help for better UX

#### v2.3.9 Do not follow symlinks unless it's the only root path to follow

This brutally fixes an issue where symbolics links are honored when they are placed in the current working directory, as internally `dua` will 
treat each cwd directory entry as individual root path.

#### v2.3.8 `dua interactive` (`dua i`) is now about twice as fast due to using all logical cores, not just physical ones

This is also the first release with github releases: https://github.com/Byron/dua-cli/releases/tag/v2.3.8

#### v2.3.7 Upgrade to filesize 0.2.0 from 0.1.0; update dependency versions

#### v2.3.6 Upgrade to jwalk 0.5 bringing better threading control and no symlink following during traversal

#### v2.3.5 Fast exit from interactive mode for a responsive exit; dependency updates (except jwalk)

#### v2.3.4 YANKED - jwalk 0.5.0 wasn't used correctly which led to a performance regression

#### v2.3.3 YANKED - journey tests failed to changed method signature

#### v2.3.2 Incude the license file in crate

#### v2.3.1 Include .md files in Crate, update dependencies

#### v2.3 Show size on disk by default; Dependency Update

Thanks to [this PR](https://github.com/Byron/dua-cli/pull/37), hard links are now not counted anymore.
The `-l` flag will count hard links as it did before. 

And of course, this has no noticable performance impact.

#### v2.2 Show size on disk by default; Dependency Update

Thanks to [this PR](https://github.com/Byron/dua-cli/pull/35), the old apparent size can be displayed with the
`-A` flag, and the much more useful 'size on disk' is now shown by default.

To my pleasant surprise, this does not seem to affect performance at all - everything stays speedy.

#### v2.1.13-- Dependency Update; Github Releases

Binaries for Linux and MacOS are now available on GitHub Releases.

#### v2.1.12-- More obvious highlighting of active panel

Depending on the terminal used, it might not have been obvious which panel was active. This might be
confusing to new and current users.
Now the color of the widget frame is changed to light gray, instead of remaining gray.

#### v2.1.11 - Finally fix symlink handling

`dua` will not follow symbolic links when deleting directories. Thank a ton, @vks!

_Technical Notes_: Handling symbolic links properly is impossible without usage of `symlink_metadata()`.

#### v2.1.10 - compatibility with light terminals

* the TUI is now usable on light terminals, and highlighting is more consistent. Thank you, @vks!
* Fixes misaligned columns when displaying '100.00%' alongside other rows by displaying `100.0%` instead. Thanks, @vks, for pointing it out.

#### v2.1.9 - improved handling of broken symlinks

* during symlink deletion, now broken symlinks will be deleted as expected.
* always return to the previous terminal screen so the TUI doesn't stick to the current one.
* display broken symlinks on the first level of iteration.

#### v2.1.8 - don't follow symbolic links when deleting directories

[A critical bug was discovered](https://github.com/Byron/dua-cli/issues/24) which would lead to deletion
of unwanted `directories` as `dua` would follow symbolic links during traversal during deletion.

Please note that symbolic links to files would be treated correctly, only removing the symbolic link.

This is now fixed.
 
#### v2.1.7 - use latest version of open-rs

That way, pressing `shift + O` to open the currently selected file won't possibly spam the terminal
with messages caused by the program used to find the system program to open the file.

Fixes [#14](https://github.com/Byron/dua-cli/issues/14)

#### v2.1.5 - re-release with Cargo.lock

#### v2.1.2 bug fixes and improvements

* Performance fix when showing folders with large amounts of files
* Display of amount of entries per directory

#### v2.1.1 bug fixes and improvements

* Better information about deletion progress
* removal of windows support

#### v2.1.0- bug fixes and improvements

* windows support (never actually worked), usage of crossterm is difficult thanks to completely
  different input handling.
* additional key-bindings
* auto-restore previous selection in each visited directory

#### v2.0.1- bug fixes and improvements

* fix typo in title 
* better display of IO-Errors in aggregate mode

#### v2.0.0 - interactive visualization of directory sizes with an option to queue their deletion

A sub-command bringing up a terminal user interface to allow drilling into directories, and clearing them out, all using the keyboard exclusively.

##### Other Features

 * [x] Single Unit Mode, see [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/bvjtan/introducing_dua_a_parallel_du_for_humans/epsroxg/)

#### 1.2 (_released_) - - the first usable, read-only interactive terminal user interface

That's that. We also use `tui-react`, something that makes it much more pleasant to handle the
application and GUI state.

#### 1.0 (_released_) - aggregate directories, fast

Simple CLI to list top-level directories similar to sn-sort, but faster and more tailored to getting an idea of where most space is used.
