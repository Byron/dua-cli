## 2.29.0 (2024-03-10)

### New Features

 - <csr-id-0c511ffa0f15e16520353ff712f6bcc11318e379/> Add scrollbar to the main entries list.
   That way it's easier to grasp how long the list is, and how fast one is
   traversing is.

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-caa1e7261bad1b0e2b10628aa14c9d2b6868a14a/> avoid crashes when the terminal is resized to unusually small sizes.
 - <csr-id-24a6c29b3f48289cb6374aa66e84357edb5d0d54/> mark-pane help bar now shows closest to the selected item.
   Previously this would only work in the first screen, but not when
   the list was long enough for scrolling.

## 2.28.0 (2024-01-23)

### New Features

 - <csr-id-78b9a8e22568c902132ed98d32e223ff71eb7b06/> add `dua i --no-entry-check` flag.
   With it, in interactive mode, entries will not be checked for presence.
   
   This can avoid laggy behaviour when switching between directories
   as `lstat` calls will not run, which can be slow on some filesystems.

## 2.27.2 (2024-01-22)

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-67c5bdb74cfcf8cab647888afec26cd09ccf543a/> allow `/` (glob-mode) while scanning.
   This will possibly lead to incomplete results, but I find being
   able to use ones muscle-memory more important than preventing
   dealing with incomplete results.
   
   What happens to me is usually to type `/` followed by `target/`
   which tends to select all current entries for deletion.
 - <csr-id-c70ca81f007f925c7891340d0d0e763bcfc4114d/> don't check entry metadata while a scan is in progress
   Previously each time the UI refreshes, every 250ms, it display
   entries but also check their metadata to assure they exist.
   
   This could lead to performance loss when the displayed folder
   has a lot of entries.

## 2.26.0 (2024-01-05)

### New Features

 - <csr-id-3c8a31b50da8230bb9268b857e00d0c90e8cb786/> responsive and buttery-smooth UI while scanning in interactive mode.
   Using `dua i` the GUI would populate and is fully usable even while the scan
   is in progress, which is fantastic when scanning big disks which can take several minutes.
   
   However, previously is was quite janky as the refresh loop was bound to receiving
   entries to process, which sometimes stalled for many seconds.
   
   Now the GUI refresh is uncoupled from receiving traversal entries, and it will
   update when the user presses a key or 250ms pass without any input, causing
   it to respond immediately.
   
   Thanks so much for contributing, [@unixzii](https://github.com/unixzii)!

## 2.25.0 (2024-01-03)

<csr-id-e992659db17f275b48e555afd6b18df737401f01/>
<csr-id-729e7e92410b138f2778ef70f0f59a439028ac29/>

### Chore

 - <csr-id-e992659db17f275b48e555afd6b18df737401f01/> remove obsolete `tui-shared` feature

### New Features

 - <csr-id-6fbe17ff51360d62086aa265a0baa9288175cb84/> add `--log-file` flag to keep track of some debug info, which includes panics.
   Previously, when `dua i` was used, panics would be hard to observe, if at all,
   as they would print to the alternate screen. Now, when the `--log-file dua.log`
   is specified, the panic will be emitted into the log file instead and thus won't
   be lost anymore.
   
   This may help with debugging in future.

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-49f98f537bf0ac41a7b1992094103f6d36f135f8/> `--ignore-dirs` now work as expected.
   Previously they would need to be specified as relative to the traversal root, which
   was unintuitive and would lead to ignores not working for many.
   
   Even though this was done for performance to avoid canonicalization, we do now
   perform a more performance version of canonicalization so the overall performance
   should be acceptable nonetheless.
   
   Also note that ignored directories are now logged when using a `--log-file`.
 - <csr-id-20e85c1ebe7ce3a5254fe2675a52cb5d321f1e34/> consistent language across the application and improved style of the Help pane.
   Generally, what was called `entry` is now called `item`, consistently.

### Other

 - <csr-id-729e7e92410b138f2778ef70f0f59a439028ac29/> clarify that (and why) `termion` isn't supported anymore in README.md
   This was triggered by `crossterm` essentially breaking event handling
   on Windows, which is when I decided to just use the seemingly more
   powerful crossterm events natively.
   
   Overall, this made event handling more complex, but also allows users of
   `crosstermion` (the crate that actually dropped `termion` support) to
   write even more interactive applications without worrying about
   the always out-of-date intermediate layer.
   
   Interestingly, the `crosstermion` crate adds some useful features around event handling,
   but also optimizes build times thanks to `termion`, which is something that
   on my current machine I don't notice anymore, so the value of it diminished greatly.

## 2.24.2 (2023-12-26)

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-b5b8aa26b648d8a034667bca8320ba7952a27780/> avoid duplicate key input on windows.
   On Windows, key-states like press/release/repeat are made available
   separately, which means we should avoid responding to key-releases
   as it would incorrectly double the actual user inputs.

## 2.24.1 (2023-12-25)

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-8ae727e462b38541636c8e03d140953cad8f34cf/> keep checking for existance of entries outside of the glob top-level.
   The glob top-level is used to display all search results which means
   that there can be a lot of them, which would unnecessarily slow down
   the search operation.
   
   Previously it would never check for the existence of an entry in glob mode,
   but now it will do so outside of the top-level.

## 2.24.0 (2023-12-24)

<csr-id-9123ee7e648fab654520c33df672c053d5797966/>

This release adds long-awaited globbing support, just hit the `/` key to get started.

You want to find the biggest `.git` directories? Just type `/.git/<enter>` and you are done. 
What about all target directories? Just write `target/` to the glob search prompt and it's done. 
What about all directories ending in `*.rs/`? 
Oh, by accident you typed `*.rs` and now there is a list of a quarter million of entries? No problem, 
it's near instant even with millions of files to search or hundreds of thousands to display.

> Note that glob-mode can be exited only by pressing `ESC` when the glob prompt has focus.

Special thanks go to [the contributor](https://github.com/gosuwachu) who made this feature happen,
along with many other improvements. Now `dua` feels refreshed for 2024, and is much more versatile.

Happy holidays!

## 2.23.0 (2023-12-11)

### New Features

 - <csr-id-98d5b5a2728e640f9d553648812df379c5534395/> display the total count of entries-to-be-deleted in the mark pane.
   This allows to better estimate how much work will be needed to perform
   the deletion.
   
   For example, when marking 3 items for deletion, previously one would see
   `3 items marked`, but now one will see all items and sub-items, like
   `120k`items marked`, which reflects the work that will be done much more
   precisely.
 - <csr-id-3241022a730dab89f13cbefbefdb583fd6a00994/> Add total size to header bar and change to aggregate, human-readable item count.
   This changes the display from `(2034 items)` to
   `(2k items, 213 MB)`, providing an overview of the total amount
   of storage used along with the total amount of files on a particular
   hiearchy level.

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-192460e5bc72781be1d238912c5d590bfed706cf/> single files will not cause IO error
   Running `dua <filename>` will once again provide size information

## 2.19.2 (2023-02-23)

<csr-id-fe956ca6f244613762bb48de79eac1f6fa399e1b/>

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-31dacad6f723f379a2d12417d65177faccd67b76/> `-x` is applied to traversal as well.
   Previously `dua` would cross filesystems for traversal and simply not
   yield them, which somewhat defeated the purpose.
   
   Now it will avoid traversing into filesystem entries that are on a different
   filesystem, which should improve its performance visibly whenever multiple
   filesystems are involved.

### Other

 - <csr-id-fe956ca6f244613762bb48de79eac1f6fa399e1b/> don't recurse on cross-device filesystems
   Like it says in the title. Right now, if you pass `-x`, dua doesn't
   count files on other devices, but it still enumerates them. However, a
   good reason to use `-x` is if you have network mounts that are slow, so
   this fixes that.

## 2.19.0 (2022-12-13)

### New Features

 - <csr-id-f073375938f742db3259ec284c3c0d4a56fd0077/> Remove the handbrake on MacOS which can now deliver the expected performance.
   Previously it would limit itself to only using 4 threads as it would
   use a lot of time in user space. This has changed now, and the traversal
   itself is much more efficient (even though it could definitely be more
   efficient when comparing to `pdu`).
   
   In any case, counting performance should now greatly improve on M1
   MacOS machines.

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-d1cdfa1d682962deea5a0c48b90589becd6e19dc/> resolve stalling issue of previous version.
   This way, this release is the working version of v2.8.1 .

## 2.18.2 (2022-12-13)

### Bug Fixes

 - <csr-id-3420dd4e14f3510662b58ae95ae7919ce0a98c95/> downgrade `jwalk` to 0.6 - the latest version does not actually iterate but instead keeps everything in memory.
   That's why `dua` didn't feel responsive anymore, was much slower and
   built up a lot of memory.

## 2.18.1 (2022-12-13)

<csr-id-946806e7390799807361562b038fb12eeb2ddf11/>
<csr-id-d3fa946029ef44e5032762ff265180c23a629316/>

Update all dependencies to the latest version. This most notably changes the look of the CLI
to something without color by default thanks to the upgrade to `clap` 4.

### Chore

 - <csr-id-946806e7390799807361562b038fb12eeb2ddf11/> replace `colored` dependency with `owo-colors`.
   The latter provide zero-allocation coloring in the terminal and
   may improve compile times a little.

### Refactor

 - <csr-id-d3fa946029ef44e5032762ff265180c23a629316/> colored path printing; fix size column format

## 2.18.0 (2022-09-12)

<csr-id-6a636d542594a76ef8b2faf2ec6347e4c8cb6b38/>

### Fixes

- Remove a duplicate draw call which would have doubled the time it takes to refresh on user input.
  This might have been noticable when large amounts of files are displayed.

### Other

 - <csr-id-6a636d542594a76ef8b2faf2ec6347e4c8cb6b38/> switch from colored to owo-colors
   owo-colors is well-maintained, zero-allocation, zero-dependencies crate
   for terminal colors. Also it works on any type that implements Display trait,
   not just on strings.

### New Features

 - <csr-id-28f5ac90cc1ba7d668ae8a83eb5cd899294a8301/> Automatically resize if the terminal changes in size.

## 2.17.1 (2022-03-20)

### Improvements to aggregate progress reporting

Previously, aggregate mode progress reports were handled by an
infinitely-looping thread carrying a 64-bit atomic of the current count,
which it would print periodically.

This resulted in #99 - breaking on platforms without 64-bit atomics,
for which a feature was added to disable it.

It also implied a race condition, where the "Enumerating ..." message
could be printed after results had been gathered but before dua exited.

Additionally, part of the status message could be left on the display if
the first line of a report was too short to cover it.

This commit should resolve these:

* The 64-bit atomic counter is replaced with an 8-bit AtomicBool
* All printing is controlled from the main thread
* The first line is cleared prior to printing a report

The only notable drawback I see with this approach is that progress
reporting can sometimes be delayed, since the display is only evaluated
for update during periods the aggregation loop makes progress. The
practical difference appears relatively minor.

Since this should resolve #99, the aggregate-scan-progress feature is
removed.

Special thanks to [@Freaky](https://github.com/Freaky) for the contribution!

### BREAKING change for package maintainers

The `aggregate-scan-progress` feature was removed as it shouldn't be required anymore.

## 2.17.0 (2022-01-21)

### New Features

 - <csr-id-e2686952b4daf4c35303689c36bebc3dfe3faf29/> interactive mode learns 'toggle [a]ll' and 'remove [a]ll'.
   In the mark pane, the 'a' key will now toggle all entries.
   This is particularly interesting for selecting entries to
   exclude by hande and then invert the selection by toggling [a]ll.
   
   In the mark pane, toggling all with the 'a' key means removing
   all entries and closing the pane.

## v2.10.9 (2021-01-07)

Fix build.

Now that `jwalk` was released in v0.6 with v0.5.2 yanked, `cargo install` will use the previous
version v0.5.1 which does not fit the latest `dua` anymore.

This is now fixed and hopefully permanently so thanks to using `jwalk` v0.6.

<csr-id-dc100c8b4a838c92f39d5a67da7eea06e7dec9af/>

Fix build.

A breaking change in jwalk can cause builds to fail. This prevents the issue from spreading at least
with dua-cli.

## v2.10.7 (2020-12-16)

Better performance on Apple Silicon (M1).

The IO subsystem on Apple Silicon is different and won't scale nicely just by using all amount of available cores. Instead it seems best to only
use as many threads as performance cores are present on the system - otherwise the performance might actually get worse while using more power.

On all other systems, the default number of threads did not change.

**Please note that for optimial performance** one would need an arm build on MacOS, currently provided is only intel builds.

## v2.9.0 (2020-07-06)

Full windows support!

## v2.8.2 (2020-07-02)

* Switch back to `clap` from `argh` to support non-UTF-8 encoded paths to be passed to dua

I hope that `argh` or an alternative will one day consider supporting os-strings, as it would in theory be an issue
for anyone who passes paths to their command-line tool.

## v2.3.9 (2020-03-27)

Do not follow symlinks unless it's the only root path to follow.

This brutally fixes an issue where symbolics links are honored when they are placed in the current working directory, as internally `dua` will 
treat each cwd directory entry as individual root path.

## v2.2.0 (2020-02-22)

Show size on disk by default; Dependency Update.

Thanks to [this PR](https://github.com/Byron/dua-cli/pull/35), the old apparent size can be displayed with the
`-A` flag, and the much more useful 'size on disk' is now shown by default.

To my pleasant surprise, this does not seem to affect performance at all - everything stays speedy.

More obvious highlighting of active panel.

Depending on the terminal used, it might not have been obvious which panel was active. This might be
confusing to new and current users.
Now the color of the widget frame is changed to light gray, instead of remaining gray.

`dua` will not follow symbolic links when deleting directories. Thank a ton, @vks!

## v2.1.9 (2019-07-21)

Improved handling of broken symlinks.

## v2.1.8 (2019-07-14)

Don't follow symbolic links when deleting directories.

[A critical bug was discovered](https://github.com/Byron/dua-cli/issues/24) which would lead to deletion
of unwanted `directories` as `dua` would follow symbolic links during traversal during deletion.

Please note that symbolic links to files would be treated correctly, only removing the symbolic link.

This is now fixed.

## v2.1.7 (2019-07-03)

Use latest version of open-rs.

That way, pressing `shift + O` to open the currently selected file won't possibly spam the terminal
with messages caused by the program used to find the system program to open the file.

   to possible delete the pane.
